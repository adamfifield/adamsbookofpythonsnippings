# ðŸ“– Recommendation Systems

### **Description**  
This section covers **user-based and item-based collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering using text similarity**, **hybrid recommendation systems**, and **deep learning-based recommendation models**.

---

## âœ… **Checklist & Key Considerations**  

- âœ… **Collaborative Filtering**  
  - Implement **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** for matrix factorization.  
  - Use **KNN-based collaborative filtering** for nearest-neighbor recommendations.  
  - Ensure **cold start problems** are addressed with hybrid methods.  

- âœ… **Content-Based Filtering**  
  - Convert textual descriptions into **TF-IDF feature vectors**.  
  - Compute **cosine similarity** for item-to-item recommendations.  

- âœ… **Hybrid Recommendation Systems**  
  - Combine **collaborative and content-based filtering** for better accuracy.  
  - Implement **weighted scores** to balance user preferences and content similarity.  

- âœ… **Deep Learning-Based Recommenders**  
  - Train **neural networks** to learn user-item interactions.  
  - Use **autoencoders** for embedding-based recommendation models.
