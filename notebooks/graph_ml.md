# ðŸ“– Graph-Based Machine Learning

### **Description**  
This section covers **graph construction and visualization**, **graph embeddings (Node2Vec, DeepWalk)**, **Graph Neural Networks (GCNs, GATs)**, and **community detection algorithms**.

---

## âœ… **Checklist & Key Considerations**  

- âœ… **Graph Construction & Visualization**  
  - Use **NetworkX** to create and manipulate graphs.  
  - Visualize graph structures using `nx.draw()`.  

- âœ… **Graph Embeddings**  
  - Train **Node2Vec embeddings** to learn node representations.  
  - Use **DeepWalk** to generate node sequences for embedding training.  

- âœ… **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**  
  - Implement **GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks)** for node classification.  
  - Use **GATs (Graph Attention Networks)** for attention-based learning.  

- âœ… **Community Detection**  
  - Apply **Girvan-Newman clustering** for detecting graph communities.  
  - Use **modularity-based methods** for social network clustering.
