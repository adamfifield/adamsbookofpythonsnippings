# ðŸ“– Graph-Based Machine Learning

### **Description**  
This section covers **graph construction**, **graph embeddings (Node2Vec, DeepWalk)**, and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**.

## âœ… **Checklist & Key Considerations**  

- âœ… **Graph Construction**  
  - Build a graph using **NetworkX (`nx.Graph()`)**.  
  - Represent nodes and edges for learning tasks.  

- âœ… **Graph Embeddings**  
  - Train embeddings with **Node2Vec** for feature representation.  
  - Use **DeepWalk** to generate node sequences.  

- âœ… **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**  
  - Use **GCNConv** layers in PyTorch Geometric.  
  - Implement message passing for graph classification.
